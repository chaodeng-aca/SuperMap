\title{Calculate Distance Between Genes and Peaks}
\usage{
gene_peak_distance(rna, atac, gene_annotation)
}
\arguments{
\item{rna}{A matrix representing the RNA modality data, where columns are features (genes) and rows are cells.}

\item{atac}{A matrix representing the ATAC modality data, where columns are features (peaks) and rows are cells.}

\item{gene_annotation}{A data frame containing gene location information (e.g., chromosome, start, end, strand).}
}
\value{
A list containing the modality data and the computed gene-peak distances. This can be used as input for downstream model fitting.
}
\description{
Compute the genomic distances between all genes in the RNA modality and all peaks in the ATAC modality.
