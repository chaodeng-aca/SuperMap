\title{Calculate Genomic Distance Between Genes and Peaks}
\usage{
gene_peak_distance(rna, atac, gene_annotation)
}
\arguments{
\item{rna}{A matrix representing the RNA modality data, where rows correspond to cells and columns correspond to genes.}

\item{atac}{A matrix representing the ATAC modality data, where rows correspond to cells and columns correspond to peaks.}

\item{gene_annotation}{A data frame containing genomic annotations for genes (e.g., chromosome, start, end, strand).}
}
\value{
A list containing the input modality data and the computed gene–peak distance matrix. The returned object can be used as input for subsequent model fitting.
}
\description{
Compute the genomic distances between all genes in the RNA modality and all peaks in the ATAC modality.
